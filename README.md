# Palmer Penguin Data Pipeline 

A data analysis pipeline using the palmer penguins dataset to explore the effects of species and sex on penguin body mass.

## Description

This data analysis pipeline involves cleaning, filtering and transforming the raw palmerpenguins dataset, so that it can be used to generate exploratory histograms to look at the distribution of the body mass of the penguins for both species and sex. The cleaning functions and clean data are also saved separately. The clean data is then used to analyse the main and interaction effects of species and sex on the body mass using a two way analysis of variance (ANOVA), and an interaction plot is generated. All graphs are saved both as functions and as separate svg. files, and each step in the pipeline process is explained in between the pieces of code.

## To get started

### Files in this repository

* Data folder including:
  - penguins_raw.csv (the raw palmerpenguins data)
  - penguins_clean.csv (the cleaned palmerpenguins data)
* Figures folder including:
  - mass_sex_histogram.svg (saved exploratory histogram for distribution of body mass for sexes)
  - mass_species_histogram.svg (saved exploratory histogram for distribution of body mass for species)
  - interaction_plot.svg (saved interaction plot)
* Functions folder including:
  - cleaning.R (saved functions to clean the raw data)
  - plotting.R (saved functions to make the graphs)
* LICENCE (the MIT licence is used)
* Question2PenguinProject.Rmd (the Rmarkdown document)
* Question2PenguinProject.pdf (the Rmarkdown as a knitted PDF)
* README.md (this file)

### What you need

* Rstudio downloaded 
* R version 4.3.2 
  
### Libraries used
* ggplot2
* palmerpenguins
* janitor
* dplyr
* svglite
* car

### Steps in the pipeline
1. Loading the data
2. Appropriately cleaning the data
3. Creating an exploratory figures (histogram)
4. Saving the Exploratory figures 
5. Formulation of hypotheses
6. Running a statistical test (2-way ANOVA)
7. Creating a results figure (interaction plot)
9. Saving the results figure
